# Python-Learning
Self learning python files.

In these folders you will find multiple python files that include personal projects, practice coding and much more.

I'm aiming to extend and enhance my python knowledge to eventually do LeetCode and complete multiple LeetCode problems with the knowledge I gain.

This also acts as a reference for anything I need to be refreshed on in the future.
